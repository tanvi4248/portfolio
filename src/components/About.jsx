        About
      </h3>
      <p className="text-zinc-300 leading-relaxed">
        A passionate web developer with a degree in Computer Science Engineering
        and nearly 10 years of experience designing, developing, and managing
        complex websites and web applications. My expertise spans front-end and
        back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, PHP, and modern JavaScript
        frameworks. <br></br>
        Over the years, Iâ€™ve become highly skilled in working with CMS platforms
        and tackling cross-browser compatibility issues to ensure smooth,
        consistent experiences for users across all devices. I also have a
        strong foundation in debugging tools, allowing me to troubleshoot and
        optimize performance effectively.<br></br>
        While my background in Computer Science Engineering has provided me with
        a solid technical foundation, my growing interest in JavaScript led me
        to further specialize in this area. To deepen my knowledge and stay on
        top of emerging trends, I recently joined a bootcamp focused on
        JavaScript frameworks.<br></br>I believe in the power of collaboration
        and communication, and I thrive in team-oriented environments where I
        can contribute to delivering high-quality solutions that meet and exceed
        client expectations. My passion for continuous learning fuels my drive
        to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices,
        ensuring I deliver clean, scalable code and exceptional user
        experiences.
